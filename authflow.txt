Auth flow looks something like this

first activation:
1. Validate license key -> Returns user data (discordId, discord name, etc etc.)
2. Post hwid / user device ID (to bind users license key to their device)

subsequent startups:
1. Validate user via hwid
2. Check user status (if subscription still active)

subsequent checks:
1. Get hwid every few seconds / minutes (ensuring that users can only use their key on 1 device at a time after they reset machine via their user dashboard for example)
