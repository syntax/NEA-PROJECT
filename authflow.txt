Auth flow looks something like this

first activation:
1. Validate license key -> Returns user data (discordId, discord name, etc etc.)
2. POST hwid / user device ID (to bind users license key to their device)
-> returns True if its not already bound, false if it is already bound.

subsequent startups:
1. Validate user via hwid
2. Check user status (if subscription still active)
-> uses a GET request

subsequent checks:
1. get hwid every few seconds / minutes (ensuring that users can only use their
key on 1 device at a time after they reset machine via their user dashboard for example)


use cases:

someone has it bound to their computer, running.
they share their lciense key with someone else, and their friend then spoofs hwid to match
that of his friend.

Friend then opens application and POSTs hwid. POST will return, false.
